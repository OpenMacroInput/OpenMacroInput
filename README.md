# Minimum Viable Open Macro Input

You want to create an application like OMI without all tools in it.
You can find the Minimum Viable version here:  
- [GitLink coming soon]

It is composed of  
- Generic Interpreter: [2022_07_12_GenericAuctionInterpretors](https://github.com/OpenMacroInput/2022_07_12_GenericAuctionInterpretors)
   - Sub module for ICommandLine:  [GitLink coming soon]
   - Sub Module for IShortcutAsText:  [GitLink coming soon]
- OMI Com Layer: [GitLink coming soon]


# Note 
I am not a good developer so I can't guarantie that this program will survive to 15-20+ years time.
But my aim to to create 60-80% of the application untemporal. Meaning that it should still work in 90 years.
At least until I die as this project is my lifetime project.

The main weak point of my project to be untemporal is Unity3D but I as I plan to do AR/VR with this project I can't skip it in the first 10 years of the project.
Plus Unity has two major point, Compute Shader and Job System that open door not available in other engine.



# Note: Elon Musk 'Merge'
A nerdy way to understand my project is this concept that Elon Musk said in an interview:  
["We need to make that tiny staw like a giant river"](https://youtu.be/MYfDtSCvex0?t=295)    
https://youtu.be/MYfDtSCvex0?t=295  
>It’s just that the data rate ... it’s slow, very slow. It’s like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. We need to make that tiny straw like a giant river, a huge, high-bandwidth interface.”  
  
The goal of this project is to communicate better with the computer(s) and with the coming AI(s) to improve our live together. For: working, playing, living.
