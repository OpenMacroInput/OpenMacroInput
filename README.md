### Open Macro Input Welcome page 👋

The goal of this project is to communicate better with the computer(s) and with the coming AI(s) to improve our live together.

I create this tool to 
- help my sister
- help me in my game and my work
- help me create virtual keyboard for XR

By having fun creating this tool, I realizee that I can be usefull to:
- People with disability that still want to use computer
- Software user that works with repetitive task: blender, photoshop, modeling...
- Video game tester that need to stress test their game mechanic with good timing
- Creative that need specific keyboard for them, or event, without heavy code behind
- Video game player that can enhance their game.
- Multiboxer & bots maker that need to play on several game or several computer
- Kickstarter maker that want to create without having to interface macro and key stroke
- ...

As you can see the list can go on and on.

Basicaly, I am creating a "no code" macro tool that can be share between the community and that still allows developer to hook & mod to the tool. 
It must be as easy as possible for none developer community but flexible enough for developer to help the community.

A nerdy way to understand my project is this concept that Elon Musk said in an interview:  
["We need to make that tiny staw like a giant river"](https://youtu.be/MYfDtSCvex0?t=295)    
> It’s just that the data rate ... it’s slow, very slow. It’s like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. We need to make that tiny straw like a giant river, a huge, high-bandwidth interface.”

### Warning

This tool is already usefull but under development.
